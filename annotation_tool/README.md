# vid-annotation

The app.js is setting up a local server to host the online annotation tool.  

All the files necessary for the tool (other than code libraries) are present in the public folder.

Note that the URL location for the actual files have been edited in the code for this public version, as we don't have rights to share the vidoes publicly.
